# UI Toggle Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the `UI Toggle` component found in [Core](https://coregames.com) Community Content.

This component will allow your players to toggle an option.  It contains easy to use events and is easy to customise.

If you want to get up and running quickly, then read the [Quick Start](quick-start) guide, otherwise I would recommend reading through the pages and then try out the example that comes with the content.
